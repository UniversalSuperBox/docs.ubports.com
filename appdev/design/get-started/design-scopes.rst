What is a scope?
----------------

Ubuntu’s scopes provide a means to display any content delivered using a
web API to users in a consistent and visually attractive manner. Scopes
provide a low cost, easy to develop option for bringing content to the
Ubuntu platform without having to commit to the development and
maintenance costs of building a fully fledged application.

Scopes are easy to create with predefined layouts and card designs that
are ready for you to piece together, in multiple ways, to create your
very own scope design.

your brand’s identity through colors, logos and arranging cards and
categories.
