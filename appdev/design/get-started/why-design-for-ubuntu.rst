-  Your app will be part of the third most deployed desktop OS in the
   world, which is free and accessible to all

-  Your app will be able to work seamlessly across all Ubuntu client
   platforms (desktop, phone, tablet)

-  The list of Ubuntu App Platform APIs is ever expanding, integrating
   all Ubuntu apps seamlessly into the Unity shell and user experience,
   whatever the app’s toolkit and coding language

-  Join a vibrant global community whose enthusiasm, energy,
   connectedness, many talents and commitment is unmatched

The Ubuntu App Platform
-----------------------

The list of Ubuntu apps is constantly growing and evolving. This tight
integration also enables a true write-once, run-everywhere approach that
conserves precious developer and designer time.

Music
-----

The Music app is a perfect example of how the Design Team has
collaborated with the community to produce a well designed and
functional app that works on all form factors.

The Clock app encapsulates the clear and concise Suru language with its
straight lines and fold out design.
