All input types supported equally
---------------------------------

In order to achieve convergence, the toolkit has adapted all components
to work seamlessly across all devices with minimal changes to
functionality and visual appearance.

This means that touch, pointer and focus interactions are now mapped to
perform similar functions across different devices for a consistent and
familiar user experience. No matter what the input method, the UI will
respond to the user’s interaction with what they expect to happen
automatically.

Use case

Fast and effortless interactions
--------------------------------

Allow users to effortlessly move through your app with minimum effort,
where it is both natural and logical to them.

Bottom edge
-----------

   366w\_BottomEdge\_AdditonalInfo3 (1)

The bottom edge allows for a natural progressive swipe from the bottom
of the screen. By using touch, clicking on the bottom edge tab with a
pointer, or pressing Return when the bottom edge tab is focused to open
using keyboard navigation.

Task switcher
-------------

The task switcher allows the user to easily switch between apps or
scopes using a right edge swipe. By pushing the pointer against the
right edge of the screen, or pressing SUPER+W.

Action placement
----------------

Throughout the Ubuntu platform positive actions, such as OK, Yes and
Accept are placed on the right, and negative actions, such as Delete and
Cancel are placed on the left.

Meaning in colors
-----------------

The Suru design language associates meanings with certain colours to
help the user distinguish between actions.

Most color blind people have difficulty distinguishing red from green.
Don’t use color in isolation, but instead bring them together with
additional visual cues (e.g. text labels, button position and style).

   750w\_DesignValues\_ColourBlue (1)

Blue is an informative colour, it is neither positive or negative. Use
blue for selected activity states. It works with all other elements, on
both dark and light backgrounds, and stands out clearly and precisely
when used in combination with a focus state.

Focus on content
----------------

Too much user interface can interfere with content; but too little can
make your app difficult to use. By focusing clearly on content many
pitfalls can be avoided.

Make it easy to find content
----------------------------

Allow users to access content easily through navigational methods by
using the most appropriate components.

|366w\_Overview\_FocusOnContentDO| |do\_32|

Do
--

The header can provide quick access to important actions and
navigational options at the top of the screen or window.

|366w\_Overview\_FocusOnContentDont| |dont\_32|

Don’t
-----

Drawers have low discoverability and can hide important views from the
user. Consider using the header or header section instead.
