Grid Unit System
----------------

A Grid Unit (GU) is a virtual measure of the screen space that is
calculated according to the device’s width in pixels and the predefined
layout. They have been designed to suit a range of screen sizes.

Placing elements
----------------

Use Grid Units to help visualise how much space you have in order to
create a consistent and proportionate UI. It proves beneficial for when
you are placing components and labels within your app.

Predefined grid unit layouts
----------------------------

The layout is calculated by taking the short edge of the screen and
dividing the amount of pixels by one of the chosen predefined layouts,
which are:

-  40/50GU for mobile and phablets screens

-  90GU for tablets, desktop and larger screens.

Example of 50GU layout for mobile
---------------------------------

A mobile device would typically suit a 50 GU-wide virtual portrait
screen, because it offers the right balance of content to screen real
estate for palm-sized viewing.

Example of 90GU layout on tablet in portrait mode
-------------------------------------------------

90GU is ideal for tablet sized screens, because it offers more
real-estate for panels.

Layouts

Panels
------

A panel is a way of grouping together Grid Units to split the screen
into different windows. Panels of predefined layouts can be joined
together to create a multi-functionally interface from portrait to
landscape.

For example, placing a 50 and 40 grid unit layout in portrait mode can
easily be translated to landscape mode for larger surfaces, such as
desktop.

If you think of it in screen sizes, the hierarchy would be:

Mobile 50GU – 1 panel (fixed panel)
-----------------------------------

Tablet – 2 panels, very occasionally 3 panels on larger tablets
---------------------------------------------------------------

Desktop – 2 or 3 panels
-----------------------

On a windowed environment, just like on a tablet, more than one panel
can be displayed simultaneously. By joining them in the same window, we
get the familiar list panel and conjoined detail panel – a pattern
typical in applications like contacts, messages, and email. Of course,
there can be any number of combinations of panels depending on the
specific app’s needs.

Use the AdaptiveLayout API to display panels in one or more columns from
left to right.

Changing the size of the window resizes one or more joined panels.
Typically, the right-most panel resizes and the left-most panel
maintains its original dimensions. The dimensions of the right-most
panel will normally be 40 or 50 grid units; though this panel may itself
be resizable depending on the developer’s requirements.

Example – 50GU phone and 50GU/variable on a desktop screen
----------------------------------------------------------

The panel that is defined as the main panel (for example 50GU) will
initially be visible in the first (leftmost) column; this will have to
be specified by the developer. The subsequent columns can then be added
depending on the device layout.

Good practice
-------------

Use a fixed panel
-----------------

   :alt: 750w\_Layouts\_GoodPractice

   750w\_Layouts\_GoodPractice

To provide a consistent user experience across the whole platform leave
at least one of the panels fixed at a minimum size of either 50 or 40GU
inside each screen size. This creates a familiar experience from mobile,
tablet and desktop.
