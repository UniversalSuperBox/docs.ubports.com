Checkbox
--------

Use a checkbox to enable or select an option from a list; or as a
singular option. For example, a singular option that is an instruction
to the system such as ‘Show password’, or selecting a property to be
applied or unapplied to add or change a setting; such as changing a font
style to ‘Bold’ and ‘Italic’.

Multiple options
----------------

.. figure:: https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/880961a6-366w_FormElements_MultipleOptions.png
   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_MultipleOptions

   366w\_FormElements\_MultipleOptions

Use multiple checkboxes to allow users to select more than one option.
For example, selecting a number of contacts from a list to delete at
once.

Single option
-------------

.. figure:: https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/72eb1894-366w_FormElements_SingleOptions.png
   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_SingleOptions

   366w\_FormElements\_SingleOptions

Use stand-alone checkboxes for a single option where the user can turn
it on or off, or select or unselect an option. For example, selecting
automatic brightness adjustment in System Settings you only need one
checkbox.

Use cases
---------

If you are asking the user to turn a setting or instruction on or off,
then use a switch instead. For example, turning the Bluetooth setting on
or off.

Do
--

Use radio buttons or a radio menu if you have enough space for both the
label and the option at once. This gives the user a clearer
understanding of the choices they can make.

|366w\_FormElements\_UseCasesDont (1)| |dont\_32|

Don’t
-----

Use a single checkbox when it is not clear what the alternative option
is. For example, the user might want to set their time zone manually, so
give them that option as well.

Selection
---------

.. figure:: https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/1f50798e-366w_FormElements_Selection-1.png
   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_Selection (1)

   366w\_FormElements\_Selection (1)

Each checkbox is independent of each other and can be selected
individually. However, if the indeterminate checkbox is checked then all
checkboxes are selected and unselected, respectively.

Confirmation
------------

.. figure:: https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/a3971eaa-366w_FormElements_Confirmation-1.png
   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_Confirmation (1)

   366w\_FormElements\_Confirmation (1)

Use for single selection where users confirm an action, such as
accepting Terms and Conditions of a setting.

Don’t make it hard for the user to understand the effect of the
unchecked value.

Alignment
---------

When aligning checkboxes with labels, or other dependent controls, it is
important that the user knows which checkbox belongs to the
corresponding explanation.

Radio buttons
-------------

Use radio buttons when there is a list of two or more options that are
exclusive of each other and only one choice can be selected.

Choosing a message tone
-----------------------

   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_MessageTone

   366w\_FormElements\_MessageTone

Clicking a non-selected radio button will deselect whichever button was
previously selected. For example, ‘Soft delay’ will be deselected if the
user selects another option.

Use other controls if necessary
-------------------------------

If you have a selection of options that are long to list and the user
could type it faster, then use a text field instead.

Don’t
-----

Don’t use a radio menu entirely for command items. If the menu never
contains any radio items, then use a toolbutton menu instead.

Radio list
----------

If you have a large set of radio buttons then place them in a list. That
way users can easily navigate and scroll through the options.

A list of organizations
-----------------------

Don’t interrupt the user
------------------------

When a user selects an option avoid hindering them from choosing another
option by opening up a dialog or closing the window.

then use a switch.

If you asking the user to choose between options to set a value, then
use checkboxes or radio buttons instead. For example, choosing a
selection of font styles where you can have a combination.

Date and time pickers
---------------------

The toolkit provides a combination of multiple pickers for you to use to
show the time and date in your app.

Spinner
-------

Use the spinner component to display a set of values on a reel that can
be either flickable or draggable.

Layout
------

There are three possible ways you can layout pickers: fullscreen
overlay, as a popover, or embedded into the UI.

Fullscreen overlay
------------------

Use a fullscreen overlay in larger screen environments, such as tablet
or desktop.

Use for popup or inline calendars when you are short of space.

Embedded

   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_embedded

   366w\_FormElements\_embedded

Use for when you want the picker to be expandable and always visible.
For example, inside the Clock app you will see it used for when you want
to edit an alarm.

Using multi-spinners
--------------------

The Time Picker supports hour, minute and seconds elements in any
combination; except hours with seconds.

Three spinner time picker

Default slider
--------------

You can use this slider to select a specific value or a maximum value in
a range. For example, adjusting the screens brightness percentage.

   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_MinimumValueSlider

   366w\_FormElements\_MinimumValueSlider

Use to select a minimum value in a range, by providing two handles that
can select between values. For example, set the value to a minimum price
range to make it easier for the user to select between prices.

Interval slider
---------------

   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_IntervalValueSlider

   366w\_FormElements\_IntervalValueSlider

The interval slider has two handles that can select between values. For
example, setting a price range between £20 to £40 inside a Shopping app.

System volume control
---------------------

A system volume control is a control that any app can embed in its UI.
You should use this slider control when your app needs only one volume
control.

   :alt: 366w\_FormElements\_VolumeControl

   366w\_FormElements\_VolumeControl

For example, if you app has a media player or is a game that has sound
effects, but no background music.It consists of a slider that
automatically reflects and adjusts the audio volume for the current
output role through the current output device.

|      | it     |

+======+========+
+------+--------+

The advantages of using system volume control:
----------------------------------------------

-  People won’t be annoyed that your app is louder or quieter than
   others, because your app uses the system audio volume

-  Volume change notifications don’t appear in front of your app when
   the slider is altered (especially important for a video player)

-  You don’t need to implement your own volume-adjusting code, because
   Ubuntu changes the volume of your app automatically

-  Any future Ubuntu features for audio routing will become available to
   your app automatically, without any code changes required

If your app plays multiple types of sound, then provide a mute button
and separate volume control for each type. For example, a game that
plays background music as well as sound effects. Avoid labelling the
system volume control because it already includes icons that indicate
its purpose.
